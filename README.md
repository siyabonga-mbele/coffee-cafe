# **XPL Full-stack developer bootcamp assessment**

# **Introduction**

You’re opening a hipster ☕️micro-roastery and need a tiny app to log each brew you make.

# **Your mission**

Ship a working full-stack **Coffee Brew Log app** that lets a user:

* Create a brew entry and save it to the database  
* Read the brew log in a list view  
* Filter the list view by brew method  
* Edit and update a brew entry  
* Delete a brew entry

# **Tech stack**

You may choose which technology you use, but you must include:

* A front-end framework like React, Vue, Svelte or Angular  
* Any CSS framework  
* A back-end framework like Node/Express, Rails, Flask, Go, Laravel etc.  
* An ORM backed by a SQL database like MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite  
* In your git repo, place your backend and frontend in their respective folders

# **Technical requirements**

### Front-end

* Split your app into sensible components.  
* Build the UI according to the wireframe images supplied below, but feel free to make your own design decisions if you think of something better.  
* Make sure that your UI is responsive.  
* The title of the page should be “Brews: {brewCount}” where brewCount is the number of brews.  
* Include validation: your brew create and brew edit forms should not allow the form to be submitted if there are blank fields.

### Back-end

* Your front-end should communicate with your back-end via a JSON API, that exposes CRUD endpoints for /api/brews.  
* Validate that all fields are supplied before saving a record.  
* Return the correct HTTP status codes as appropriate.

### Documentation and collaboration

* Include a file Documentation.md with setup instructions and a description of the project.  
* Keep your git history tidy and commit each feature with a descriptive commit message.

### Security hygiene

* Don’t hardcode any secrets. You must read from ENV vars where relevant, and include a .env.example file for easy setup.

### Deployment

* Deploy your app using any hosting service you want, and include the URL in a file “[deployment.md](http://deployment.md)” in your repo. If you aren’t sure which host to use, [render.com](http://render.com) has a free tier you can use.  
* If you struggle with deployment, add some notes to “[deployment.md](http://deployment.md)” including what you tried to troubleshoot and solve it.
